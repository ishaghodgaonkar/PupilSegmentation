# PupilSegmentation

This code attempts to segment pupils from an image using semantic segmentation using U-Net[1], and uses DeepVOG [2] to construct ellipses. 
Diameter measurements are the average of the major and minor axis. 
A demo can be run on the test set provided by [3] by running 'python3 eval.py' or on the video provided by [3] running 'python3 test.py'. 

Dependencies:
NumPy
torch
torchvision
segmentation_models_pytorch
matplotlib
PIL
cv2
